## Disclaimer

This is just a hobby project and **using any of the provided code / files is at your own risk!**

In my interpretation, this UI mod falls under the category of "Cosmetic UI mods" which should not result in VAC ban (see for example: [link](https://dota2.gamepedia.com/Ban#Exceptions)). But to reiterate, using it is your own responsibility. 

## Description

This repository contains the Javascript code that is added to the Dota 2 UI code. See the [`generator`](https://github.com/auto-chess-ui-mod/generator) repository for the Python code that is used to add this code and create the VPK file.
